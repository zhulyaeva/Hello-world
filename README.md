# Hello-world
Space for new ideas, drafts and other useful information.
Just a little bit about myself: I am a data analyst professional with experience working in Eviews, STATA, MatLab, Python, VBA etc. 
I love learning new skills, working on different projects with other contributors to make beautiful things.
